Below are representative prompts used with ChatGPT to generate and debug the Terraform and deployment scripts.

1. "Generate Terraform configuration to provision a VPC, public subnet, an EC2 instance, and an RDS Postgres instance. Output separated into main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf. Use Ubuntu AMI."

2. "Create a user_data script for the EC2 instance that installs Docker, docker compose, clones a given Git repo, and runs docker compose to build and run services."

3. "Write a docker-compose.yml that builds frontend and backend from local Dockerfiles and wires a DATABASE_URL env var for the backend."

4. "Create a deployment.md explaining how to use terraform and the assumptions."
